#### How do you set up a local testing server?

Navigate to the directory that your web is inside, using the cd command.

Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:

    # On Mac and Linux
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # On Windows and Mac
    python -m http.server

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser.
